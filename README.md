## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
    Allow users to pledge money, which will increase backers and pledged and could ultimately change the number of funded games.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Some introduced functions such as reduce and filter were a little hard to get used to, so I had to read more outside information about it.
